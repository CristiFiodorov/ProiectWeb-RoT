                    This SRS describes the general specifications for the <b class="bold-text--blue">Romanian Traffic Tutor</b> application v1.0. We created this application during the Web Technologies course, in the fourth semester 
                    of University at the Faculty of Computer Science, Ia»ôi. Because the full project is not finished yet, this paper aims to describe the product scope, different characteristics and details regarding 
                    the user interfaces, and several application features. We will cover the back-end components of the application later, in an updated version of this documentation.
                    <!-- Identify the product whose software requirements are specified in this document, 
                    including the revision or release number. Describe the scope of the product that is

                    The <b class="bold-text--blue">Romanian Traffic Tutor</b> application aims to help those who are struggling to pass their driving license exam. All the laws 
                    from the Traffic Code are presented in an interactive way, making it easier for the users to learn. All the traffic signs are concisely presented in a 
                    separate section, with a lot of real examples. The users should be able to test their understanding by taking quizes, ordered by difficulty levels. 
                    A scoreboard to track the progress and performance should also be provided, both within the application and as a RSS feed.

                <h3>2.1 Product Motivation</h3>
                <p>
                    Driving is a crucial part of modern life, providing individuals the freedom to go where they want in relatively short time. However, driving comes with a lot of 
                    risks and dangers that can be minimized by knowing the laws and regulations of the traffic code.
                    Unfortunately, there are drivers who don't know even the elementary rules in traffic, which can make them more likely to cause accidents or receive traffic violations.
                    Additionally, attending driving school and passing the driving exam can be difficult for some people, as they may have trouble retaining the information they learn. 
                    This can lead to a sense of frustration and lack of confidence. To address these issues, we aim to create a modern application that teaches all the laws and signs 
                    from the traffic code in an interactive and engaging way. Our application will provide a variety of quizzes organized by difficulty levels, so that users can test 
                    their knowledge and improve their understanding of the traffic code. By doing so, we hope to make a positive impact in the society and help new drivers feel more confident and 
                    safe behind the wheel.

                <h3>2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints</h3>
                <p>

                    The development of the Romanian Traffic Tutor app will have some constraints regarding the use of tools and frameworks. 
                    The grading policy prohibits the use of frontend or backend frameworks, and any tools used must have an open license.
                    To comply with these constraints, the development team will rely on HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript for the interface, 
                    without using any frontend or backend frameworks. The team will also use Node.js for the backend, 
                    but without the use of web server frameworks like Express.

                    <!-- Describe any items or issues that will limit the options available to the developers. 
                    These might include: corporate or regulatory policies; hardware limitations (timing requirements, 
                    memory requirements); interfaces to other applications; specific technologies, tools, and databases 
                    to be used; parallel operations; language requirements; communications protocols; security 
                    considerations; design conventions or programming standards (for example, if the customer‚Äôs 
                    organization will be responsible for maintaining the delivered software). -->
