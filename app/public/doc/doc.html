                        Tutor</b> application v1.0. We created this application during the Web Technologies course, in
                    the fourth semester
                    of University at the Faculty of Computer Science, Iași. Because the full project is not finished
                    yet, this paper aims to describe the product scope, different characteristics and details regarding
                    the user interfaces, and several application features. We will cover the back-end components of the
                    application later, in an updated version of this documentation.

                <p>
                    The <b class="bold-text--blue">Romanian Traffic Tutor</b> application aims to help those who are
                    struggling to pass their driving license exam. All the laws
                    from the Traffic Code are presented in an interactive way, making it easier for the users to learn.
                    All the traffic signs are concisely presented in a
                    separate section, with a lot of real examples. The users should be able to test their understanding
                    by taking quizes, ordered by difficulty levels.
                    A scoreboard to track the progress and performance should also be provided, both within the
                    application and as a RSS feed.

                <h3>2.1 Product Motivation</h3>
                <p>
                    Driving is a crucial part of modern life, providing individuals the freedom to go where they want in
                    relatively short time. However, driving comes with a lot of
                    risks and dangers that can be minimized by knowing the laws and regulations of the traffic code.
                    Unfortunately, there are drivers who don't know even the elementary rules in traffic, which can make
                    them more likely to cause accidents or receive traffic violations.
                    Additionally, attending driving school and passing the driving exam can be difficult for some
                    people, as they may have trouble retaining the information they learn.
                    This can lead to a sense of frustration and lack of confidence. To address these issues, we aim to
                    create a modern application that teaches all the laws and signs
                    from the traffic code in an interactive and engaging way. Our application will provide a variety of
                    quizzes organized by difficulty levels, so that users can test
                    their knowledge and improve their understanding of the traffic code. By doing so, we hope to make a
                    positive impact in the society and help new drivers feel more confident and
                    safe behind the wheel.

                    The development of the Romanian Traffic Tutor app will have some constraints regarding the use of
                    tools and frameworks.
                    The grading policy prohibits the use of frontend or backend frameworks, and any tools used must have
                    an open license.
                    To comply with these constraints, the development team will rely on HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript for
                    the interface,
                    without using any frontend or backend frameworks. The team will also use Node.js for the backend,
                    but without the use of web server frameworks like Express.

                <p>
                    The application follows a client-server architecture, consisting of a <strong>REST-API
                        server</strong> and a <strong>Client-Centric Web Application</strong>.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        On the server-side, the <strong>REST-API</strong> server is implemented in <b>Node.js</b>,
                        utilizing the <b>HTTP</b>
                        module to handle incoming requests and provide API endpoints. The server exposes several routes
                        that allow for Create, Read, Update, and Delete (<strong>CRUD</strong>) operations on various
                        entities, including
                        courses, traffic signs, advice, quizzes, scoreboard, and authentication. Each API request is
                        processed, and the server generates JSON responses that adhere to a specific format defined by
                        the application. These responses consist of a status attribute indicating the success or failure
                        of the operation, a data attribute containing the requested data or relevant information, and a
                        message attribute providing additional details or error messages. This structured format ensures
                        consistency and ease of parsing on the client-side.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        The application architecture includes a database layer powered by <strong>MongoDB</strong>,
                        a non-relational database system, and <strong>Mongoose</strong>, a robust ODM library for
                        MongoDB in Node.js.

                        Within the REST-API server, the Mongoose library is utilized to define models that map to
                        specific collections in the MongoDB database. These models define the schema, including the
                        fields, data types, and validation rules for each entity such as courses, traffic signs, advice,
                        quizzes, scoreboard, and user. Mongoose also provides convenient methods to
                        perform CRUD operations on the database, simplifying the process of interacting with MongoDB
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        On the client-side, the Web Application leverages the <b>Fetch API</b> to interact with the
                        server and retrieve JSON responses. The application dynamically constructs web pages by
                        utilizing <b>JavaScript</b> and <b>DOM manipulation</b> techniques. When a user performs an
                        action,
                        such as navigating to a specific page or submitting a form, the Web Application initiates a
                        request using the Fetch API to the corresponding API endpoint on the server. Upon receiving the
                        JSON response, the client-side JavaScript code processes the data and dynamically updates the
                        web page's content, ensuring a seamless and interactive user experience. This Client-Centric
                        approach enables efficient rendering of content on the client-side, reducing server load and
                        providing a responsive user interface.
                    </li>
                    <p>
                        By combining the server-side REST-API implementation with the client-side Web Application built
                        on JavaScript and DOM manipulation, the application achieves a robust and scalable
                        architecture. The separation of concerns between the server and client components allows for
                        independent development, maintenance, and scalability of each layer. This architecture fosters
                        efficient communication between the server and client, facilitating seamless data exchange,
                        dynamic page rendering, and a user-friendly interface.

                <h3 id="authentification-module">4.2 Authentification Module</h3>
                <p>
                    The authentification module is based on the following MongoDB <span
                        class="schema--green">User</span> collection:
                </p>
                <img id="user-schema" src="images/schemas/User.jpg">
                <p>
                    As it can be observed from the image, the password is encrypted using the <strong>bcrypt</strong>
                    library.
                    Also, this module enforce the authorization of the API by using <strong>Json Web Token
                        (JWT)</strong>.
                    On the Client Web Application, the JWT is stored in the <strong>localStorage</strong> and is sent to
                    the server on each request
                    as an <strong>authorization header</strong>.
                </p>
                <h3 id="courses-module">4.3 Courses Module</h3>
                <p>
                    The courses module is based on the following MongoDB collections:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p><span class="schema--green">Course</span> collection</p>
                        <img id="course-schema" src="images/schemas/Course.jpg">
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><span class="schema--green">Chapter</span> collection</p>
                        <img id="chapter-schema" src="images/schemas/Chapter.jpg">
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><span class="schema--green">Chapter-Content</span> collection</p>
                        <img id="content-schema" src="images/schemas/Content.jpg">
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    As it can be observed from the collections, the course might contain several chapters and each
                    chapter contains a specific chapter content.
                    The chapter content logic was designed as follows: Each element of the page might be of three types:
                    <strong>paragraph</strong>, <strong>subsection</strong> or <strong>image</strong>.
                    All of these elements are stored as an array in the content attribute. This array is then parsed by
                    the client and the page is rendered accordingly.
                    All this data might be exported by the normal user as a JSON or CSV file. Also, the <span
                        class="admin-span">administrator</span> can import an entire content for a chapter from a
                    local JSON file that should respect the template imposed by the <span
                        class="schema--green">Chapter-Content</span> schema. All the CRUD operations are implemented
                    both on server-side and client-side, and have each operation has a corresponding role permission.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another important aspect is that the images are stored in cloud using <strong>Azure Cloud
                        Storage</strong>. Thus, when the admin uploads an image for a course, it is stored in the cloud
                    and the link is saved in the database.
                </p>
                <h3 id="traffic-signs-advices-module">4.4 Traffic Signs and Advice Module</h3>
                <p>
                    The traffic signs and advice module is based on the following MongoDB collections:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p><span class="schema--green">Sign Category</span> collection</p>

                </ul>
                <p>
                    As it can be observed from the collections, a sign category may contain several traffic signs
                    (mapped by the parentId attribute).
                    Also, there is an advice collection that has a structure similar to that of a traffic sign.
                    All this data might be exported by the normal user as a JSON or CSV file. All the CRUD operations
                    regarding these entitites are implemented both on server-side and client-side, and have each
                    operation
                    has a corresponding role permission.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another important aspect is that the images are stored in cloud using <strong>Azure Cloud
                        Storage</strong>. Thus, when the <span class="admin-span">administrator</span> uploads an image
                    for a traffic sign, a sign category or
                    an advice, it is stored in the cloud and the links are saved in the database.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All the data regarding the sign categories and specific signs was extracted from <a

                <ul>
                    <li>

                </ul>
                <p>
                    As it can be observed from the collections, each quiz contains an array of questions (each mapped by
                    its ObjectId).
                    Each question has three answer options, each having a flag representing wether the option is correct
                    or not.
                    An <span class="admin-span">administrator</span> has the ability to add a new question, that will
                    have the chance to be part of a

                </p>
                <p>
                    Each question might have an image in it. Question images are stored in cloud using <strong>Azure

                <p>
                    Our application uses the following <strong>node.js libraries</strong>
                </p>
                <h4 id="jsonwebtoken-library">4.8.1 jsonwebtoken</h4>
                <p>
                    We use this library in order to have a secure and efficient way to <strong>sign</strong> and
                    <strong>verify</strong> JSON Web Tokens.
                    Several important aspects regarding the application's security such as token authenticity and
                    expiration are handled with the
                    help of this library. One of the notable advantages of a Json Web Token is its
                    <strong>stateless</strong> nature.
                    It does not rely on server-side session state, all the the information needed being stored in the
                    token itself.
                </p>
                <h4 id="bcrypt-library">4.8.2 bcrypt</h4>
                <p>
                    This library provides a robust hashing algorithm that strengthens the security of stored
                    passwords. It is used to hash the user's password before storing it in the database. In this way, we
                    make
                    sure that the user's personal data is confidential and protected, even in the case of a database
                    breach.
                </p>

                </p>
                <h4 id="azure-storage-library">4.8.4 azure/storage-blob</h4>
                <p>
                    This library provides an efficient way to interact with the Azure Cloud Storage. It allows us to
                    upload and manage photos in an Azure Container. By using cloud services we allow efficient and
                    secure management of the application's media assets.
                </p>
                <h4 id="formidable-library">4.8.5 formidable</h4>
                <p>
                    This library provides an efficient way to handle image uploads. It excels at processing incoming
                    <strong>multipart/form-data</strong> requests, making it a good choice for handling file
                    uploads and form submissions.
                </p>
                <h4 id="nodemailer-library">4.8.6 nodemailer</h4>
                <p>
                    This library offers a straightforward solution for sending emails from our application. It
                    simplifies the process
                    of sending password reset emails to an address given by the user.
                </p>
